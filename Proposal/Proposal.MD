## Project Title
[Concise, descriptive title. Example: "Community Detection in Social Networks Using Louvain Algorithm"]

## Abstract
[In 100-150 words, summarize the problem, proposed approach, graph mining techniques, and expected outcomes. Keep high-level.]

## Problem and Motivation
[In 200-250 words, describe the research question and its importance in graph mining. Include real-world applications or datasets. Reference 1-2 course concepts (e.g., centrality, link prediction).]

## Objectives
[State 3-4 specific, measurable objectives in bullet points.]  
- Objective 1: [e.g., Analyze a graph dataset for structural properties.]  
- Objective 2: [e.g., Implement and compare two algorithms.]  
- Objective 3: [e.g., Evaluate using key metrics.]  

## Related Work
[In 100-150 words, summarize 2-3 key papers/resources. Explain how your project builds on them. Use APA/IEEE citations.]

## Proposed Methodology
[In 250-300 words, outline your approach. Use subsections for clarity.]  

### Dataset(s)
[Source, size (nodes/edges), type (directed/undirected), and preprocessing.]

### Techniques and Algorithms
[Key methods, tools (e.g., NetworkX), and rationale. Use bullets.]  
- [Technique 1: Brief description.]  
- [Technique 2: Brief description.]  

### Evaluation Plan
[Metrics (e.g., modularity, AUC) and baselines.]

## Challenges and Resources
[In 100 words, list 1-2 challenges and mitigations.]

## References
[3-6 citations in chosen style.]
