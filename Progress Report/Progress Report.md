## Executive Summary
[In 150-200 words, provide an overview of progress since the proposal. Highlight key achievements, any deviations from the plan, preliminary findings, and outlook for completion. Mention alignment with objectives.]

## Progress on Objectives
[In 300-400 words, update on each objective from the proposal. Use subsections or bullets for clarity. Describe what has been accomplished, with evidence (e.g., code snippets, dataset stats, initial outputs). If an objective is partially met or behind, explain why.]

### Objective 1: [Restate from Proposal]
[Describe progress, e.g., "Dataset collected and preprocessed; initial graph visualization completed." Include metrics or figures if applicable.]

### Objective 2: [Restate from Proposal]
[Describe progress, e.g., "Implemented Louvain algorithm; tested on subsample of data."]

### Objective 3: [Restate from Proposal]
[Describe progress, e.g., "Preliminary evaluation shows modularity score of 0.65."]

## Work Accomplished
[In 400-500 words, detail major tasks completed. Break into subsections. Include code, diagrams, or tables to illustrate (e.g., a sample graph or algorithm pseudocode).]

### Dataset Preparation and Analysis
[Discuss data acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory analysis. E.g., "Processed Facebook graph dataset with 4,039 nodes and 88,234 edges. Computed degree distribution (skewed, power-law fit)."]

### Implementation Details
[Outline algorithms/tools used so far. E.g., "Used NetworkX for graph construction and PyG for GNN experiments. Code repository: [link if applicable]."]

### Preliminary Results
[Present initial findings with visuals if possible. E.g., "Clustering results: Detected 15 communities; visualization below."  
*(Insert figure placeholder: e.g., Community structure plot)*  
Use tables for quantitative results.]

| Metric          | Value       | Baseline | Notes                  |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| Modularity      | 0.65        | 0.50     | Louvain on full graph  |
| Runtime (s)     | 45          | N/A      | On standard laptop     |

## Challenges Encountered and Resolutions
[In 200-250 words, discuss 2-3 obstacles faced (e.g., data sparsity, computational limits) and how addressed (e.g., sampling techniques, cloud resources). If unresolved, outline contingency plans.]

- **Challenge 1:** [Description]  
  **Resolution:** [Actions taken/outcome]  

- **Challenge 2:** [Description]  
  **Resolution:** [Actions taken/outcome]
